🛒 Product Management CRUD App

A simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows you to manage a list of products with fields such as title, price, taxes, ads, discount, count, and category.
All data is stored locally using the browser's LocalStorage, so no backend or database is required.

📋 Read Products: View all products in a list.

✏️ Update Products: Edit product details and save changes.

❌ Delete Products: Remove one or multiple products from the list.

🔍 Search Products: Search by title or category.

⚙️ How It Works

Fill in the product details (title, price, taxes, ads, discount, count, category).

Click Create to add the product(s).

If count > 1, multiple products will be created at once.

Products are displayed in a table below.

Use the Search option to filter products by title or category.

Use the Update button to edit an existing product.

Use the Delete button to remove a product.

All data is saved in LocalStorage, so it remains after refreshing the page.
